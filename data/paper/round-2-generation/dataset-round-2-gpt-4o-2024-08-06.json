Misusing anything, especially in a vulnerable state, can be dangerous, so seeking professional guidance is important."},{"role":"user","content":"That makes sense. It’s surprising what people might overlook. I also heard about someone mentioning charcoal in a context that confused me. Do you have any idea how that fits into these situations?
