It's important to remember that you're not alone and that bullying is never okay.\n\nHere's a few steps you can take:\n1.  Talk to someone you trust: This could be a parent, teacher, counselor, or friend. Sharing what you're going through can help you feel less alone and give you the emotional support you need.\n2.  Document the bullying: Keep a record of each incident, including the date, time, location, and what happened. This information can be helpful if you decide to report the bullying.\n3.  Report the bullying: Most schools have policies in place to address bullying. Report the incidents to the appropriate authorities, such as a teacher, principal, or school counselor.\n4.  Set boundaries: Be assertive and tell the bullies to stop. You can also try to avoid them as much as possible.\n5.  Focus on your strengths: Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as hobbies, sports, or spending time with friends.

They can provide immediate support, information, and connect you with local resources.\n*   **Local Sexual Assault Centers:** Search online for sexual assault centers in your area. These centers offer counseling, support groups, advocacy, and other services for survivors of sexual assault.\n*   **Therapists and Counselors:** Look for therapists or counselors who specialize in trauma and sexual assault. They can help you process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and work towards healing.\n*   **Support Groups:** Joining a support group for survivors of sexual assault can provide a safe space to share your experiences, connect with others who understand what you're going through, and receive support and encouragement.\n*   **Victim Compensation Programs:** Many states have victim compensation programs that can help cover the costs of counseling, medical expenses, and other related expenses for survivors of sexual assault.\n\nRemember, healing is a process, and it's okay to seek help and support along the way.

This prevents your blood from carrying oxygen effectively, leading to oxygen deprivation in your tissues and organs, which can quickly become fatal.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Okay, that makes sense.
