People often turn to various coping mechanisms like substance use, isolation, or creative outlets when they're feeling lost, driven by a desire to escape pain or find relief.

Some people may turn to it with the hope of alleviating symptoms of various ailments, but it's crucial to note that its effectiveness isn't scientifically validated for everything, and improper use can lead to issues like nutrient absorption problems.
